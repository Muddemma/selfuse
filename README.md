This image illustrates the workflow of our project management application. 

- **Context**: This screenshot is taken from the main dashboard of the application, where users can manage their tasks and projects.
- **Details**: The dashboard shows a list of tasks categorized by their status (To Do, In Progress, Done). Each task card contains the task title, assigned person, and due date.
- **Purpose**: The image demonstrates the user-friendly interface and the organized way tasks are displayed, which is a key feature of our application.
- **Additional Information**: The colors used in the task cards represent different priority levels (red for high priority, yellow for medium, green for low).

By following this structure, you can provide a comprehensive and clear description of the image in your `README.md` file.
